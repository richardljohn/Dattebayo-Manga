                            Dattebayo Manga is a store that sells all kinds of books and comics. We specialize mainly in manga and offer a wide range of manga to choose from. This ranges from classic mangas to the newest mangas. However, we also sell popular comics from Avatar, DC and Marvel, Korean Manga or Manhwa, and books such as A Song Of Ice and Fire. The purpose of Dattebayo Manga is to allow fans of manga and comics to have a dedicated store to find and explore a gigantic library of content specially designed for them. We started with our Founder Mr. Richard John who came to America from India in 2005. Originally it was only a small operation while and we only had a handfull of mangas to sell. However, in 2020 we were able to grow and recruit more and more team members. As we grew in numbers, we were able to acquire more and more mangas and books to sell. We are also partnered with Crunchyroll and Funimation, two of the biggest anime streaming services ever. Currently, we are mainly based in the US, but we have centers for Dattebayo Manga in many other areas such as Japan, Germany, France, India, and Australia.

                        Richard John came to America from his home of Kerela, India in 2005. When Mr. John was in high school he discovered a love for manga and anime. He was able to watch anime and read manga online, however, he was not able to access these stories easily. In 2019, he decided to launch a store that would sell manga and books to people who have a love of anime and manga. He named his store Dattebayo Manga after a catch phrase from the manga Naruto, which is his favorite manga series of all time.

                        Our team at Dattebayo Manga is working on a daily basis to acquire more and more mangas and books to sell. When Dattebayo Manga started in 2019 our team was very small. However, over time we amassed more and more members. Along with members that furthered Dattebayo Manga's growth, we have many people who want to release a manga of their own. We have many exclusive mangas in development and are actively recruiting new members as well to either help Dattebayo Manga grow more or share their own ideas.
